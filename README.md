# visualizations-of-values-inside-NeuralNet
Visualizations of some different values inside neural network with pytorch based on ideas from [Andriej Karpathy's lecture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P6sfmUTpUmc&t=0s). When a neural network is large and has many layers, it can run into problems that will significantly worsen training.
BatchNorm layers are used to solve these problems. Both notebooks contain visualizations of different values inside neural network, one without the Batchnorm layers and the other with them.
